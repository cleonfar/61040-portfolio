**DOMAINS**



Tennis: I played tennis in high school and also play with my dad.



Chess: I play a lot of chess in my free time.



PSETS: Like all MIT students I do PSETS



Movies/Shows: I enjoy watching movies and shows in my free time or with my family.



Agriculture: Several generations of my family have raised corn and soybeans in Iowa.



Books: I enjoy reading but often struggle to know what books I might like



Video Games: I like to spend some of my free time playing video games

**Problem 1**: In competitive video games it can sometimes be difficult for players to understand their progress over time. Simple win/loss records might not tell the whole story, and more insight and analytics could be useful.

**Problem 2**: It can be difficult for players to find new games to play. A lot of time could be spent searching for games that have the right vibe and price point.

**Problem 3**: It can be fun for players to unlock achievements in games, but sometimes difficult to know which achievements are worth going for.



Livestock: My dad used to raise sheep, chickens, turkeys, and other livestock, and I spent a many of my summers helping with the animals. He and my uncle own two large barns for raising poultry. They have had a lot of issues with the companies they raised for going out of business. In a few months they will be raising chickens again. I would enjoy creating something that could be used to make work easier for my family to manage.



 	**Problem 1**: When raising sheep it is very beneficial to keep track of an immense amount of data related to the herd. Age of the animals, daily weight gain for lambs, average lamb output of mothers, etc. is all important information for farmers. It can tell which mothers are good and which may need culled, when lambs should be ready for market, or give broader indications to the overall health of the flock. If farmers are unable to easily keep and analyze this information it could translate to significant losses in money for the farmer.



 		**Selection**: One reason that I like this is it's an idea I've had kind of kicking around in the back of my mind for 4 or 5 years now, so I feel like I have some head start on what I would be wanting to do. A reason I don't like it as much is my family has gotten out of the sheep business so it wouldn't be as useful to us anymore.

 	**Problem 2**: Animal feed can be critical to the health of the animal, and feed can also be expensive. Balancing the cost of feed with the necessary nutritional value for the animals health can be difficult for farmers. A feed planning and scheduling app could help farmers balance these factors.



 	**Problem 3**: Tracking profits can be difficult for farmers. The cost of feed, equipment, medicines, and the animal itself all need to be tracked. With all these factors it can be difficult for a farmer to pinpoint where they are mismanaging their money.







Golf: I enjoy playing golf in the summers a few times a week with my family.



 	**Problem 1**: When playing a round of golf if can be difficult to identify where in the round you were gaining or losing strokes. I can often have holes where I perform poorly but am unable to pinpoint where exactly I cost myself so many strokes. Having more detailed insights into what I do well or poorly in a round could help be choose what to practice or make different decisions on the course to avoid bad results.



&nbsp;		**Selection**: I chose this because it seems like something that I and many other golfers would use and enjoy having. I think having an app for tracking more data than just total strokes would be something that golfers who are actively trying to improve their would consider almost necessary.

 	**Problem 2**: Since golfers often play in groups, a scheduling app could be useful for coordinating tee times with friends. It could also potentially tie in with courses  for available times and weather apps to help groups make decisions.



&nbsp;		**Selection**: I chose not to select this for a few reasons. The biggest reason is that to me this seems like a problem that could easily be solved with texting or some other messaging system. It doesn't seem necessary to me to build an entire app for this, and I don't see golfers thinking this is something they cannot live without.





 	**Problem 3**: Like all sports, practice is important in golf, but it can be difficult to know what to practice or keep track of their practice. Especially tracking things like club distance an accuracy over time can be quite difficult. Often when I'm practicing I tend to just grab clubs that I think need some work, hit a random number of balls, and judge how successful the practice session was mostly on vibes. Having something to give a more structured approach to practice that could quickly give detailed feedback could be beneficial.



 		**Selection**: I chose this because it seems like something that I and many other golfers would use and enjoy having. I think having an app for improving practice for golf would be very useful for improving my and other golfers game.
