A small-scale livestock producer is juggling dozens of animals across multiple herds. They are attempting to keep track of births, weights, weanings, and herd movement through memory and notes taken. As their operation grows and the notes become more cumbersome and disorganized they begin to realize the current system isn’t sustainable.  
They open the HerdBase and land on the Home screen (see homepage sketch), where clear options like Add Animal, Create Herd, and Generate Report are immediately visible. They begin by registering each animal using the Animal Identity feature, assigning tags, birthdates, and parentage. Then, they organize animals into herds using the Herd Management page (see herd sketch), where they can view, split, move, and merge herds with just a few clicks.  
When an animal is born, they log the event using the Record Birth button. Weeks later, they can return to record the weaning of the offspring and record survivability—no need to re-enter data or guess dates. Periodically, they use Record Weight to track growth.  
To evaluate performance, they visit the Report Generation page (see report sketch), select a report type to generate, and select an animal or herd. The results help guide decisions about feeding strategies, sales timing, and breeding plans.  
By season’s end, the producer has a clean, centralized record of every key event. The app didn’t just digitize their workflow—it clarified it. And in an industry where timing, traceability, and precision matter, that clarity is transformative.
