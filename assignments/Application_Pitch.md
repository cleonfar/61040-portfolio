Name: HerdBase  
  
Motivation: To provide people who raise livestock a system for easily recording, tracking, and analyzing important herd information.  

Key Features:  
1. Herd Management: A tool for quickly and easily creating and tracking groups of animals. Should allow the user a simple method of organizing their animals into groupings that they want to track and manage. Allow the user to designate a group with a predesigned or custom type to help focus the data and analytics kept on the group.  

2. Record Information: A way for the user to quickly enter an animalâ€™s information into the system. Give the user the option to select what pieces of information they want to be recording in a session so that as they are working with the animals they are not being prompted for more or less than they need.  

3. Data Analysis: Allow the user to generate reports on the animals based on the recorded information. Users can view summaries and trends of specific animals or groups. These could include weight gain, mortality, reproductive performance, and more. There could be a possible opportunity for AI integration in this feature to help users make farm management decisions based on the analysis.
