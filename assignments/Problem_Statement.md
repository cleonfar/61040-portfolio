**PROBLEM STATEMENT**  
	Problem Domain: Livestock: My dad is a farmer and has raised many different kinds of livestock, including sheep, turkeys, chickens, cows, and more. I spent a lot of time working with him to care for and raise the animals, and have first hand experience with many of the difficulties that can be involved with raising livestock. I have especially noticed difficulties we’ve had with the software we’ve used for keeping and analyzing data related to some of the animals that we’ve looked after.  
  
  
	Problem: When raising livestock it is very beneficial to keep track of an immense amount of data related to the herd. Age of the animals, rate of weight gain, average offspring output of mothers, etc. is all important information for farmers. It can tell which mothers are good and which may need culled, when lambs should be ready for market, or give broader indications to the overall health of the flock. If farmers are unable to easily keep and analyze this information it could translate to significant losses in money for the farmer and affect the health of the herd.  
  
  
A STAKEHOLDER LIST:  
Farmers: The primary users of the app who actually encounter the problem and would be using the app to mitigate or handle it.  
Animals: Indirect stakeholders, but better record keeping and analytics would likely help farmers identify issues in the herd or with an animal more quickly, which could improve the animals’ health and quality of life  
Customers: Indirect stakeholders who may benefit from the app improving a farm’s ability to produce more and higher quality meat  
Slaughter barns: Similar to customers, would benefit from farms being more efficient in their production of meat.  
Veterinarians: Could make use of the records to better care for the animals.
